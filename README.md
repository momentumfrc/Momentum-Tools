## Momentum-PID (**DEPRECATED**)

Custom momentum pid controller.

This project was created because we had several issues with the default
wpilib-provided PID implementation. However, in the last few years,
wpilib has updated their PID implementation to fix these issues. Thus
this project has been deprecated.
